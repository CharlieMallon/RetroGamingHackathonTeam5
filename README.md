  </summary>

It is possible to copy the repository to your local machine so that you can fix merge conflicts, add or remove files and push larger commits without affecting the original project code. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repo data that GitHub has at that point in time. See the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) for further information, and below for a brief summary...

1. [**Sign in** to your GitHub account](https://github.com/login) and locate the [relevant repository](https://github.com/CharlieMallon/RetroGamingHackathonTeam5).
2. Click on the **Code** dropdown next to the green **Gitpod** button. This will reveal the **Clone** option.
3. In order to clone the repository using `HTTPS`, select **HTTPS** and copy the link shown (there is a copy button to the right of the URL).
4. Next, open **Git Bash** (see [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for an overview of download options, if required).
5. Change the current working directory on your local machine to the location where you want the cloning to be made.
6. Type `git clone` into your IDE terminal followed by the URL you copied in Step 3 above, i.e.
